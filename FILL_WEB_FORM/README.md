# FILL WEB FORM USING VBA AND PYTHON

This example fills a web form using data in Excel. 
We use VBA to call the exe file. This file is created with python and then converted to an exe file.
The Python file uses the win32com library to read the data from the Excel file and, Selenium to fill the web form.
After the task is complete, one cell is changed and control returns to Excel VBA macro.
